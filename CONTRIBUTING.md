## General guidelines for contributing

If you design a new API or make changes to an existing one, remember thant tens of thousands of
games and apps rely on the existing API design. Our API is a contract between Corona and it's
users, we do not want to break it unless absolutely necessary. If you're designing a new
API, try to follow existing naming conventions for names and parameters.

Make sure to test your changes, preferably on several platforms.

## File headers

All source code files in Corona must have a header with some information and license.
If you're adding a file, make sure to include header in it. File headers are available in
[FILE_HEADER.md](FILE_HEADER.md).
