## Feature highlights

### Corona Simulator and Live Builds
Corona speeds up the development process. Update your code, save the changes, and instantly see the results in our instant-update Simulator. When you're ready to test on real devices, build and deploy your app just once and then see code/assets update automatically, all over your local network. It's like magic.

### Lua-based
Lua is an open source scripting language designed to be lightweight, fast, yet also powerful. Lua is currently the leading scripting language in games and has been utilized in Warcraft ™, Angry Birds ™, Civilization ™, and many other popular franchises.

### Plugins for all needs
Select from numerous plugins which extend the Corona core for features like in-app advertising, analytics, media, and much more. A vast variety of plugins is available via [Corona Marketplace](https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/).

### Call any native library
If it’s not already in the core or supported via a plugin, you can call any native (C/C++/Obj-C/Java) library or API using Corona Native. It also allows to easily package your code as a plugin.

### Cross-platform
Develop for mobile, desktop, and connected TV devices with just one code base.
