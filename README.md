# Solar2D-98 


This is my personal Solar2D/Corona repo, I plan to use this fork to push out new feature early.



Note:
You are welcome to build and use this Simulators from fork but don't expect the same amount of support and stability as the main repo

Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/coronalabs/corona/releases) page


## FAQ

### Does this replace coronalabs/corona repo/releases?

This repo is not designed to replace main repo

### Will this fragment Solar2D/CoronaSim?

No, all features in the repo should make there way into the main repo

### I have a feature request and/or a bug

please report it in the main repo, not here or to my dm's

### Why 1998?

Birth Year :) and wanted to make clear difference between current build and beta builds
