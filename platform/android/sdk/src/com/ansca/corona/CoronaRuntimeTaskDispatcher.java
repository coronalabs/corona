/**
 * Allows you to send tasks to be executed on the {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntime CoronaRuntime's} thread, just before Corona 
 * renders a frame. These tasks provide thread safe access to the {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntime CoronaRuntime} and its 
 * {@link com.naef.jnlua.LuaState LuaState}.
 * <p>
 * The main intention of this class is to provide a means for other threads to invoke Lua functions or
 * manipulate Lua global variables belonging to the {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntime CoronaRuntime's} 
 * {@link com.naef.jnlua.LuaState LuaState}. This is done by implementing the {@link com.naef.jnlua.LuaState LuaState} manipulation code 
 * within a {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntimeTask CoronaRuntimeTask} object and then sending that task object
 * to the {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntime CoronaRuntime} via this class' 
 * {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntimeTaskDispatcher#send(com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntimeTask) send()} method. This class will handle 
 * this in a thread safe manner and make sure that the task object is executed on the 
 * {@link com.ansca.corona.CoronaRuntime CoronaRuntime's} thread, just before it renders a frame.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are immutable.
