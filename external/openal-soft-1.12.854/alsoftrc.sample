# OpenAL config file. Options that are not under a block or are under the
# [general] block are for general, non-backend-specific options. Blocks may
# appear multiple times, and duplicated options will take the last value
# specified.
# The system-wide settings can be put in /etc/openal/alsoft.conf and user-
# specific override settings in ~/.alsoftrc.
# For Windows, these settings should go into %AppData%\alsoft.ini
# The environment variable ALSOFT_CONF can be used to specify another config
# override

# Option and block names are case-insenstive. The supplied values are only
# hints and may not be honored (though generally it'll try to get as close as
# possible). Note: options that are left unset may default to app- or system-
# specified values. These are the current available settings:

## format:
#  Sets the output format. Can be one of:
#  AL_FORMAT_MONO8    (8-bit mono)
#  AL_FORMAT_STEREO8  (8-bit stereo)
#  AL_FORMAT_QUAD8    (8-bit 4-channel)
#  AL_FORMAT_51CHN8   (8-bit 5.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_61CHN8   (8-bit 6.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_71CHN8   (8-bit 7.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_MONO16   (16-bit mono)
#  AL_FORMAT_STEREO16 (16-bit stereo)
#  AL_FORMAT_QUAD16   (16-bit 4-channel)
#  AL_FORMAT_51CHN16  (16-bit 5.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_61CHN16  (16-bit 6.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_71CHN16  (16-bit 7.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_MONO32   (32-bit float mono)
#  AL_FORMAT_STEREO32 (32-bit float stereo)
#  AL_FORMAT_QUAD32   (32-bit float 4-channel)
#  AL_FORMAT_51CHN32  (32-bit float 5.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_61CHN32  (32-bit float 6.1 output)
#  AL_FORMAT_71CHN32  (32-bit float 7.1 output)
#format = AL_FORMAT_STEREO16

## cf_level:
#  Sets the crossfeed level for stereo output. Valid values are:
#  0 - No crossfeed
#  1 - Low crossfeed
#  2 - Middle crossfeed
#  3 - High crossfeed (virtual speakers are closer to itself)
#  4 - Low easy crossfeed
#  5 - Middle easy crossfeed
#  6 - High easy crossfeed
#  Users of headphones may want to try various settings. Has no effect on non-
#  stereo modes.
#cf_level = 0

## head_dampen:
#  Sets the amount of dampening on sounds emanating from behind the listener.
#  This is used to simulate the natural occlusion of the head, which is
#  typically missing with mono and stereo output, and as such, only works on
#  mono and stereo output modes. Valid values range from 0 to 1 (inclusive),
#  and higher values provide a stronger effect.
#head_dampen = 0.25

## frequency:
#  Sets the output frequency.
#frequency = 44100

## resampler:
#  Selects the resampler used when mixing sources. Valid values are:
#  0 - None (nearest sample, no interpolation)
#  1 - Linear (extrapolates samples using a linear slope between samples)
#  2 - Cosine (extrapolates using a (co)sine slope)
#  Specifying other values will result in using the default (linear).
#resampler = 1

## rt-prio:
#  Sets real-time priority for the mixing thread. Not all drivers may use this
#  (eg. PulseAudio) as they already control the priority of the mixing thread.
#  0 and negative values will disable it. Note that this may constitute a
#  security risk since a real-time priority thread can indefinitely block
#  normal-priority threads if it fails to wait. As such, the default is
#  disabled.
#rt-prio = 0

## period_size:
#  Sets the update period size, in frames. This is the number of frames needed
#  for each mixing update. If the deprecated 'refresh' option is specified and
#  this isn't, the value will be calculated as size = refresh/periods.
#period_size = 1024

## periods:
#  Sets the number of update periods. Higher values create a larger mix ahead,
#  which helps protect against skips when the CPU is under load, but increases
#  the delay between a sound getting mixed and being heard.
#periods = 4

## sources:
#  Sets the maximum number of allocatable sources. Lower values may help for
#  systems with apps that try to play more sounds than the CPU can handle.
#sources = 256

## stereodup:
#  Sets whether to duplicate stereo sounds on the rear and side speakers for 4+
#  channel output. This can make stereo sources substantially louder than mono
#  or even 4+ channel sources, but provides a "fuller" playback quality. True,
#  yes, on, and non-0 values will duplicate stereo sources. 0 and anything else
#  will cause stereo sounds to only play out the front speakers.
#stereodup = false

## drivers:
#  Sets the backend driver list order, comma-seperated. Unknown backends and
#  duplicated names are ignored. Unlisted backends won't be considered for use
#  unless the list is ended with a comma (eg. 'oss,' will list OSS first
#  followed by all other available backends, while 'oss' will list OSS only).
#  An empty list means the default.
#drivers = pulse,alsa,oss,solaris,dsound,winmm,port,wave

## excludefx:
#  Sets which effects to exclude, preventing apps from using them. This can
#  help for apps that try to use effects which are too CPU intensive for the
#  system to handle. Available effects are: eaxreverb,reverb,echo
#excludefx =

## slots:
#  Sets the maximum number of Auxiliary Effect Slots an app can create. A slot
#  can use a non-negligible amount of CPU time if an effect is set on it even
#  if no sources are feeding it, so this may help when apps use more than the
#  system can handle.
#slots = 4

## sends:
#  Sets the maximum number of auxiliary sends per source. The total number of
#  sends possible is defined at compile time and thus can not be increased
#  beyond the default (2).
#sends = 2

## layout_STEREO:
#  Sets the speaker layout when using stereo output. Values are specified in
#  degrees, where 0 is straight in front, negative goes left, and positive goes
#  right. Unspecified speakers will remain at their default position. Available
#  speakers are front-left(fl) and front-right(fr).
#layout_STEREO = fl=-90, fr=90

## laytout_QUAD:
#  Sets the speaker layout when using quadriphonic output. Available speakers
#  are back-left(bl), front-left(fl), front-right(fr), and back-right(br).
#layout_QUAD = bl=-135, fl=-45, fr=45, br=135

## layout_51CHN:
#  Sets the speaker layout when using 5.1 output. Available speakers are back-
#  left(bl), front-left(fl), front-center(fc), front-right(fr), and back-
#  right(br).
#layout_51CHN = bl=-110, fl=-30, fc=0, fr=30, br=110

## layout_61CHN:
#  Sets the speaker layout when using 6.1 output. Available speakers are side-
#  left(sl), front-left(fl), front-center(fc), front-right(fr), side-right(sr),
#  and back-center(bc).
#layout_61CHN = sl=-90, fl=-30, fc=0, fr=30, sr=90, bc=180

## layout_71CHN:
#  Sets the speaker layout when using 7.1 output. Available speakers are back-
#  left(bl), side-left(sl), front-left(fl), front-center(fc), front-right(fr),
#  side-right(sr), and back-right(br).
#layout_71CHN = bl=-150, sl=-90, fl=-30, fc=0, fr=30, sr=90, br=150

#  still prevent autospawning even if this is set to true.
#spawn-server = false

## buffer-length:
#  Specifies the PulseAudio buffer length, in sample frames. When set to a
#  non-0 value, it specifies the total buffer length for the playback stream,
#  overriding the period settings. Otherwise it uses the period size and count
#  to calculate a buffer size. PulseAudio, unlike other backends, does not work
#  in period chunks, but instead just has one buffer block which is refilled as
#  it nears empty. Because of this, the usual buffering metrics are unsuitable,
