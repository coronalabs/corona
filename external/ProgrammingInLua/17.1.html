<p><h2>17.1 - Memoize Functions</h2>

<p>A common programming technique is to trade space for time.
You can speed up some functions by <em>memoizing</em> their results
so that, later, when you call the function with the same arguments,
it can reuse the result.

<p>Imagine a generic server that receives
requests containing strings with Lua code.
Each time it gets a request,
it runs <code>loadstring</code> on the string,
and then calls the resulting function.
However, <code>loadstring</code> is an expensive function
and some commands to the server may be quite frequent.
Instead of calling <code>loadstring</code> over and over
each time it receives a common command like <code>"closeconnection()"</code>,
the server can <em>memoize</em> the results from <code>loadstring</code>
using an auxiliary table.
Before calling <code>loadstring</code>,
the server checks in the table whether that string
already has a translation.
If it cannot find the string,
then (and only then) the server calls <code>loadstring</code>
and stores the result into the table.
We can pack this behavior in a new function:
<pre>
    local results = {}
    function mem_loadstring (s)
      if results[s] then      -- result available?
        return results[s]     -- reuse it
      else
        local res = loadstring(s)   -- compute new result
        results[s] = res            -- save for later reuse
        return res
      end
    end
</pre>

<p>The savings with this scheme can be huge.
However, it may also cause unsuspected wastes.
Although some commands repeat over and over,
many other commands happen only once.
Gradually,
the table <code>results</code> accumulates
all commands the server has ever received
plus their respective codes;
after enough time, this will exhaust the server's memory.
A weak table provides a simple solution to this problem.
If the <code>results</code> table has weak values,
each garbage-collection cycle will remove
all translations not in use at that moment
(which means virtually all of them):
<pre>
    local results = {}
    setmetatable(results, {__mode = "v"})  -- make values weak
    function mem_loadstring (s)
       ...    -- as before
</pre>
Actually, because the indices are always strings,
we can make that table fully weak, if we want:
<pre>
    setmetatable(results, {__mode = "kv"})
</pre>
The net result is exactly the same.

<p>The memoize technique is also useful to ensure the uniqueness of
some kind of object.
For instance, assume a system that represents colors as tables,
with fields <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, and <code>blue</code> in some range.
A naive color factory generates a new color for each new request:
<pre>
    function createRGB (r, g, b)
      return {red = r, green = g, blue = b}
    end
</pre>
Using the memoize technique,
we can reuse the same table for the same color.
To create a unique key for each color,
we simply concatenate the color indices with a separator in between:
<pre>
    local results = {}
    setmetatable(results, {__mode = "v"})  -- make values weak
    function createRGB (r, g, b)
      local key = r .. "-" .. g .. "-" .. b
      if results[key] then return results[key]
      else
        local newcolor = {red = r, green = g, blue = b}
        results[key] = newcolor
        return newcolor
      end
    end
</pre>
An interesting consequence of this implementation is that
the user can compare colors using the primitive equality operator,
because two coexistent equal colors
are always represented by the same table.
Note that the same color may be represented by
different tables at different times,
because from time to time a garbage-collector cycle
clears the <code>results</code> table.
However, as long as a given color is in use,
it is not removed from <code>results</code>.
So, whenever a color survives long enough to be compared with a new one,
its representation also survives long
enough to be reused by the new color.
