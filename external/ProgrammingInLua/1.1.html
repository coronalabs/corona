<p><h2>1.1 - Chunks</h2>

<p>Each piece of code that Lua executes,
such as a file or a single line in interactive mode,
is a <em>chunk</em>.
More specifically, a chunk is simply a sequence of statements.

<p>A semicolon may optionally follow any statement.
Usually, I use semicolons only to separate two or more statements
written in the same line, but this is just a convention.
Line breaks play no role in Lua's syntax;
for instance, the following four chunks are all valid and equivalent:
<pre>
    a = 1
    b = a*2
    
    a = 1;
    b = a*2;
    
    a = 1 ; b = a*2
    
    a = 1   b = a*2    -- ugly, but valid
</pre>

<p>A chunk may be as simple as a single statement,
such as in the "hello world" example,
or it may be composed of a mix of statements and
function definitions
(which are assignments actually, as we will see later),
such as the factorial example.
A chunk may be as large as you wish.
Because Lua is used also as a data-description language,
chunks with several megabytes are not uncommon.
The Lua interpreter has no problems at all with large sizes.

<p>Instead of writing your program to a file,
you may run the stand-alone interpreter in interactive mode.
If you call Lua without any arguments,
you will get its prompt:
<pre>
    Lua 5.0  Copyright (C) 1994-2003 Tecgraf, PUC-Rio
    >
</pre>
Thereafter,
each command that you type (such as <code>print "Hello World"</code>)
executes immediately after you press <code>&lt;enter></code>.
To exit the interactive mode and the interpreter,
just type <em>end-of-file</em>
(<code>ctrl-D</code> in Unix, <code>ctrl-Z</code> in DOS/Windows),
or call the <code>exit</code> function,
from the Operating System library
(you have to type <code>os.exit()&lt;enter></code>).

<p>In interactive mode, Lua usually interprets each line that you type
as a complete chunk.
However, if it detects that the line cannot form a complete chunk,
it waits for more input,
until it has a complete chunk.
When Lua is waiting for a line continuation,
it shows a different prompt (typically <code>>></code>).
Therefore, you can enter a multi-line definition,
such as the <code>factorial</code> function,
directly in interactive mode.
Sometimes, however,
it is more convenient to put such definitions in a file,
and then call Lua to run that file.

<p>You can execute a sequence of chunks by giving them all as arguments
to the stand-alone interpreter, with the <code>-l</code> option.
For instance,
if you have a file <code>a</code> with a single statement <code>x=1</code>
and another file <code>b</code> with the statement <code>print(x)</code>,
the command line
<pre>
    prompt> lua -la -lb
</pre>
will run the chunk in <code>a</code>, then the one in <code>b</code>,
which will print the expected 1.
(The <code>-l</code> option actually calls <code>require</code>,
which looks for the files in a specific path.
So, the previous example will not work
if this path does not include the current directory.
We will discuss the <code>require</code> function
in more details in <a href="8.1.html#require">Section 8.1</a>.)

<p>You may use the <code>-i</code> option to instruct Lua to
start an interactive session after running the given chunks.
A command line like
<pre>
    prompt> lua -i -la -lb
</pre>
will run the chunk in <code>a</code>, then the one in <code>b</code>,
and then prompt you for interaction.
This is especially useful for debugging and manual testing.
At the end of this chapter
we will see other options for the stand-alone interpreter.

<p>Another way to link chunks is with the <code>dofile</code> function,
which immediately executes a file.
For instance, you may have a file <code>lib1.lua</code>:
<pre>
    -- file 'lib1.lua'
    
    function norm (x, y)
      local n2 = x^2 + y^2
      return math.sqrt(n2)
    end
    
    function twice (x)
      return 2*x
    end
</pre>
Then, in interactive mode, you can type
<pre>
    > dofile("lib1.lua")   -- load your library
    > n = norm(3.4, 1.0)
    > print(twice(n))      --> 7.0880180586677
</pre>

<p>The <code>dofile</code> function is useful also when you are
testing a piece of code.
You can work with two windows:
One of them is a text editor with your program
(in a file <code>prog.lua</code>, say)
and the other is a console running Lua in interactive mode.
After saving a modification that you make to your program,
you execute <code>dofile("prog.lua")</code> in the Lua console to
load the new code;
then you can exercise the new code,
calling its functions and printing the results.
