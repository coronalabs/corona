<a name="weaktables"><h1>17 - Weak Tables</h1></a>

<p>Lua does automatic memory management.
A program only creates objects (tables, functions, etc.);
there is no function to delete objects.
Lua automatically deletes objects that become garbage,
using <em>garbage collection</em>.
That frees you from most of the burden of memory management and,
more important,
frees you from most of the bugs related to that activity,
such as dangling pointers and memory leaks.

<p>Unlike some other collectors,
Lua's garbage collector has no problems with cycles.
You do not need to take any special action
when using cyclic data structures;
they are collected like any other data.
Nevertheless, sometimes even the smarter collector needs your help.
No garbage collector allows you to forget all worries about
memory management.

<p>A garbage collector
can collect only what it can be sure is garbage;
it cannot know what you consider garbage.
A typical example is a stack,
implemented with an array and an index to the top.
You know that the valid part of the array goes only up to the top,
but Lua does not.
If you pop an element by simply decrementing the top,
the object left in the array is not garbage for Lua.
Similarly,
any object stored in a global variable is not garbage for Lua,
even if your program will never use it again.
In both cases, it is up to you (i.e., your program) to
assign <B>nil</B> to these positions so that they do not lock
an otherwise free object.

<p>However, simply cleaning your references is not always enough.
Some constructions need extra collaboration
between you and the collector.
A typical example happens when you want to keep a collection of all
live objects of some kind (e.g., files) in your program.
That seems a simple task:
All you have to do is to insert each new object into the collection.
However, once the object is inside the collection,
it will never be collected!
Even if no one else points to it,
the collection does.
Lua cannot know that this reference should not prevent the
reclamation of the object,
unless you tell Lua about that.

<p>Weak tables are the mechanism that you use to tell Lua
that a reference should not prevent the reclamation of an object.
A <em>weak reference</em> is a reference to an object that is not
considered by the garbage collector.
If all references pointing to an object are weak,
the object is collected
and somehow these weak references are deleted.
Lua implements weak references as weak tables:
A <em>weak table</em> is a table where all references are weak.
That means that, if an object is only held inside weak tables,
Lua will collect the object eventually.

<p>Tables have keys and values
and both may contain any kind of object.
Under normal circumstances,
the garbage collector does not collect objects that
appear as keys or as values of an accessible table.
That is, both keys and values are <em>strong</em> references,
as they prevent the reclamation of objects to which they refer.
In a weak table, keys and values may be weak.
That means that there are three kinds of
weak tables:
tables with weak keys, tables with weak values,
and fully weak tables, where both keys and values are weak.
Irrespective of the table kind,
when a key or a value is collected the whole entry
disappears from the table.

<p>The weakness of a table is given by the field <code>__mode</code>
of its metatable.
The value of this field, when present,
should be a string:
If the string contains the letter `<code>k</code>&acute; (lower case),
the keys in the table are weak;
if the string contains the letter `<code>v</code>&acute; (lower case),
the values in the table are weak.
The following example, although artificial,
illustrates the basic behavior of weak tables:
<pre>
    a = {}
    b = {}
    setmetatable(a, b)
    b.__mode = "k"         -- now `a' has weak keys
    key = {}               -- creates first key
    a[key] = 1
    key = {}               -- creates second key
    a[key] = 2
    collectgarbage()       -- forces a garbage collection cycle
    for k, v in pairs(a) do print(v) end
      --> 2
</pre>
In this example,
the second assignment <code>key = {}</code> overwrites the first key.
When the collector runs,
there is no other reference to the first key,
so it is collected
and the corresponding entry in the table is removed.
The second key, however, is still anchored in variable <code>key</code>,
so it is not collected.

<p>Notice that only objects can be collected from a
weak table.
Values, such as numbers and booleans,
are not collectible.
For instance, if we insert a numeric key in table <code>a</code>
(from our previous example),
it will never be removed by the collector.
Of course,
if the value corresponding to a numeric key is collected,
then the whole entry is removed from the weak table.

<p>Strings present a subtlety here:
Although strings are collectible,
from an implementation point of view,
they are not like other collectible objects.
Other objects, such as tables and functions,
are created explicitly.
For instance,
whenever Lua evaluates <code>{}</code>, it creates a new table.
Whenever it evaluates <code>function () ... end</code>,
it creates a new function (a closure, actually).
However, does Lua create a new string when it
evaluates <code>"a".."b"</code>?
What if there is already a string <code>"ab"</code> in the system?
Does Lua create a new one?
Can the compiler create that string before running the program?
It does not matter:
These are implementation details.
Thus, from the programmer's point of view,
strings are values, not objects.
Therefore, like a number or a boolean,
a string is not removed from weak tables
(unless its associated value is collected).
