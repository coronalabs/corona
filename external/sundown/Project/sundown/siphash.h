   This version was modified by Salvatore Sanfilippo <antirez@gmail.com>
   in the following ways:

   1. Hard-code 2-4 rounds in the hope the compiler can optimize it more
      in this raw from. Anyway we always want the standard 2-4 variant.
   2. Modify the prototype and implementation so that the function directly
      returns an uint64_t value, the hash itself, instead of receiving an
      output buffer. This also means that the output size is set to 8 bytes
      and the 16 bytes output code handling was removed.
   3. Provide a case insensitive variant to be used when hashing strings that
      must be considered identical by the hash table regardless of the case.
      If we don't have directly a case insensitive hash function, we need to
      perform a text transformation in some temporary buffer, which is costly.
   4. Remove debugging code.
   5. Modified the original test.c file to be a stand-alone function testing
      the function in the new form (returing an uint64_t) using just the
      relevant test vector.
