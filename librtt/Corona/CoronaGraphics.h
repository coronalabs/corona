/**
 This structure contains callbacks required for TextureResource's life cycle
 When Corona would require some information about Texture or it's bitmap, a callback would be invoked
 `userData` parameter is passed to all callbacks is same with which TextureResourceExternal was created
 Typical workflow & callbacks descriptions:
  - time to time Corona would request `getWidth()` and `getHeight()` for various calculation
  - when texture's bitmap data is required:
      * to retrieve raw data pointer `onRequestBitmap()` is called
      * `onRequestBitmap()` should always return valid pointer
        to `getWidth()*getHeight()*CoronaExternalFormatBPP(getFormat())` bytes
      * pixels should be aligned row-by-row; first byte of pixel on row `Y` and column `X`:
        `((unsigned char*)onRequestBitmap())[ (Y*getWidth() + X) * CoronaExternalFormatBPP(getFormat())]`
      * Corona would read data for a short time and call `onReleaseBitmap()` when done
      * bitmap pointer need not be valid after `onReleaseBitmap()` is called
      * `onRequestBitmap()` (and consequent `onReleaseBitmap()`) may be called several times when data access is required
  - `getFormat()` should return bitmap format; if NULL RGBA would be used
      * if `kExternalBitmapFormat_Mask` is returned, texture would be treated as mask
  - `onFinalize()` if present, would be called when texture is no longer needed. Usually happens when `texture:releaseSelf()`
    is called and all objects using texture are destroyed. Also called when app is shutting down or restarted
  - `onGetField()` is used when user queries texture for unknown field from Lua. Returned number
    must be a number of values pushed on Lua stack

 In order to create external bitmap you must provide width, height and bitmap callbacks
 all other are optional and will be ignored if set to NULL
